description: Use at the start of any task that produces files or code changes, to list every required deliverable and house rule before writing any code.
---
Before writing or editing anything, build an explicit checklist of every required output and rule. Do not start coding until this list exists.

## Steps
1. Read the task instruction and any `README.md` in the workspace end to end.
2. If a `check.py` / checker / test harness exists in the task directory, read it — it encodes the exact expected schema, field names, sorting, and conventions. Prefer it over guessing.
3. Extract and write down, as a literal checklist:
   - Every file that must exist (exact path and name).
   - Every required field / column / key and its exact type and format.
   - Every house rule stated (naming, sorting, units, headers, changelog, tests).
   - Any "do not modify" constraints (e.g. existing tests).
4. Keep the checklist visible and tick items off as you go.

## Common required artifacts to look for
- A specific output file (e.g. `answer.json`, `errors.json`, `clean.csv`) — not just "an answer".
- A `meta` / metadata block with source file name, row counts, etc.
- Regression tests in a specific file, one test per fix.
- A `CHANGELOG.md` entry under a specific heading with a specific bullet format.
- Type annotations on all public functions.

## Anti-patterns to avoid
- Assuming "tests pass" means the task is done.
- Inventing your own schema (extra fields like `currency`, `generated_at`) instead of the required one.
- Skipping a deliverable because it "seems optional".

## Final gate
Before declaring done, re-read the checklist and confirm each required file exists at the exact path and each required field is present with the correct type/format.
